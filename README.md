# Student Teacher Portal

This is a Django backend project that I worked on while learning Django.
I used this project to understand how a real backend application is structured and how different parts of Django work together.

## What I learned
- Django project and app structure
- Creating models and working with Django ORM
- Handling database changes using migrations
- Writing views and connecting them with URLs
- Using Django admin to manage data

## Tech stack
- Python
- Django
- SQLite (for local development)
- HTML and CSS (Django templates)

## How to run locally
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python manage.py migrate  
python manage.py runserver  

## Notes
- This is a learning project and is not deployed.
- Database files are not committed; migrations are used instead.
